This is my first post on this website. Hopefully this website will include my professional portfolio some day too as well as be a platform for a blog of some kind including the things that I want to share online from sports to personal experiences. This project has been long overdue. I actually wanted to make my own website and add it to my resume for interviewers to look at, but now after a year later, I am already working at a company and starting to work on this site is a hilarious thing on its own. After wasting the HostGator subscription for the entire year, this is something to make up for the guilt of wasted $52 (thanks I guess to Thomas Frank for the discount LOL). 

Negativity aside, I hope this website brings about some positivity in me and I look forward to see where this goes in the next few months! I hope you like it!

PEACE OUT!
